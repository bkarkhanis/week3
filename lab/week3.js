// Usage: getRandomInt(6)
// Outputs a random number between 1 and max
function getRandomInt(max) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * Math.floor(max)) + 1
}

// Goal: Read the "Musicessories" database into memory; write information
// about products and promotions to the JavaScript Console.
// - PART 1: Write out the number of products/promotions in the database, in a human-readable
//   format, to the JavaScript console, e.g. "There are x products."
// - PART 2: Write the name, description, and price of the first 3 products to the JavaScript
//   console ‚Äì the name, description, and price should each be on its own line, and the
//   price should be formatted like "$5.49 each".
// - PART 3: Get a random promotion from the list of promotions. Display the description of the
//   promotion, along with the appropriate emoji.
//   - Discount = ü§ë
//   - Shipping = üöõ
//   - Contest = üèÜ

// Code that runs when the page finishes loading
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', async function() {
  // retrieves data from products API endpoint
  let response = await fetch('https://kiei451.com/api/products.json')
  let data = await response.json()

  // writes the product data to the JavaScript console
  console.log(data)

  // üî• YOUR CODE GOES HERE üî•
  // Write the recipe (algorithm) in the comments. Then, write the code.

  // PART 1
  // Figure out how many products there are, and store that number in memory
  let ProductCount = data.products.length
  
  // Figure out how promotions there are, and store that number in memory
  let PromotionCount = data.promotions.length
  
  // Write the number of products to the JavaScript console
  console.log(`Number of products: ${ProductCount}`)

  // Write the number of promotions to the JavaScript console
  console.log(`Number of promotions: ${ProductCount}`)

  // PART 2
  // Store the first product in memory
  let FirstProduct = data.products[0]
  

  // Write the first product to the JavaScript console, on three separate lines
  console.log(`First product: ${FirstProduct.name}`)
  console.log(`First product price: ${FirstProduct.price}`)
  console.log(`First product description: ${FirstProduct.description}`)

  // Repeat for the 2nd and 3rd products
  
 
  // Store the second product in memory
  let SecondProduct = data.products[1]

  // Write the product to the JavaScript console, on three separate lines
  console.log(`Second product: ${SecondProduct.name}`)
  console.log(`Second product price: ${SecondProduct.price}`)
  console.log(`Second product description: ${SecondProduct.description}`)
  // Store the third product in memory
  let ThirdProduct = data.products[2]
  

  // Write the product to the JavaScript console, on three separate lines
  console.log(`Third product: ${ThirdProduct.name}`)
  console.log(`Third product price: ${ThirdProduct.price}`)
  console.log(`Third product description: ${ThirdProduct.description}`)

  // PART 3
  // Get a random integer between 1 and 10
  let Integer = getRandomInt(10)

  // Subtract one from that random integer because Arrays are zero-based
  let Promotion = Integer - 1

  // Use the random integer to grab a promotion from the Array of promotions
  console.log(`Promotion of the day: ${data.promotions[Promotion].type}`)
  // and store it in memory
  let PromoOfTheDay = data.promotions[Promotion]

  // Figure out which emoji should be displayed, store it in memory
  let Emoji
  if (PromoOfTheDay.type == `discount`) {Emoji = `ü§ë`}
  else if (PromoOfTheDay.type == `shipping`) {Emoji = `üöõ`}
  else {Emoji = `üèÜ`}
 
  // Create a sentence that displays the emoji along with the description
  console.log(`${Emoji}: Promo of the day: ${PromoOfTheDay.description}`)
  
  // of the promotion

  // Write the sentence to the JavaScript console
